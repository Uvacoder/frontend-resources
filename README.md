# Frontend Developer Resources

I've been collecting a good deal of bookmarks as I've learned web dev. I thought it might be a fun project, and hopeful a few people find some new resources that help them.

## How It's Made:

- **Code:** React & Typescript
- **Boilerplate:** Next.js
- **Styles:** Tailwind & DaisyUI
- **State Management:** No need for anything fancy here, just a little prop drilling

I chose not to use anything besides vanilla React for state management here, but if this were a larger project I would have gone with Redux. But with a simple project like this, I feel like there's no need for anything extra.

## Lessons Learned:

This was my first time using DaisyUI, and I enjoyed using it. When I was customizing different element, I never felt like I was fighting it, and I think it spend up the development of the project a good deal.
